Hi, I am a computer engineering undergrad at [Universidade Federal do Esp√≠rito Santo](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Federal_University_of_Esp%C3%ADrito_Santo),
currently in semester 5. I am interested in learning opportunities, working in projects (mostly hardware, embeding, graphics)

I have knowledge about web development, both frontend and backend, but it is not my passion, nor I wish to work with it. I am more interested in circuitry,
microcontrolers, hardware related subjects, and math, I really like math. Right now my focuses is on computer architectury, operational systems inner workings, among other things.

I am currently working with esp microcontroller, embeding a deep learning model into it as an attempt to create a skin lesion evaluation device for the [current
lab](https://life.inf.ufes.br) I am working on. Things have been flowing well, if you want to know. 
In the mean time, I am studying to get a deep understanding in transformers (the math ones, suchs as laplace transform, fourier transform, etc), eletromagnetism,
and as I said before, computer inner workings.

What I know: 

- Core math: Calculus, statistics, complex numbers, trigonometry, etc  (I won't list them all here)
- Classical physics: mechanics, thermodynamics, all that stuff. I am not an expert, but I
  like physics, and study about it whenever I can. Hoping to study about quantum and relativity soon.
- Circuit analisys, still practicing and getting a deeper understanding.
- Programming, of course. I won't get in details, but C, C++, java, js, ts, python, etc. Also, a  l o t  of frameworks.
- I just learned about MIPS architecture, and I am planning on studying more modern ones.

[Here](https://informatica.ufes.br/sites/informatica.ufes.br/files/field/anexo/ppc-engcomp-2022-rev-fev-2025.pdf) is information of my course (it is in portuguese) 
you may check the classes I took graphically, [here](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1TA8ZmzK8Y2KaSyATYYQK3tRy-btoLLwd/view), I am currently on semester 5.
[here](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1LE0NyNKazTgPKrl5KxRgW117ckUPPa0h/view) you can have a brief description of each class.

If you want my grades, I may provide that information privatly, contact me.

So this is a brief resume of what I know. It is pretty hard to put everything in words, I know what I know, I am still studying and practicing.
I am also eger to study more subjects, if you have an idea you want to share, feel free.
