Hello, my name is Rafael, I love stuff that make me think, like puzzles and math. I was very bored, until I discoverd the incredible world of coding, and started my journey through it. I'm still learning and exploring all the tools and rules, I hope to one day be able to really understand how this world works, and then use its rules for explore and understand my own world.

Nowadays I'm studying the web and school subjects like geography, history, portuguese (I'm brazilian by the way), all the boring things needed to get into a good university.
Furthermore, I'm learning english, I still need to practice more, especially speaking, but there are other things to focus on now, I can improve my skills on that later.

I also like music, [here](https://open.spotify.com/playlist/7yLRwaK1v9mT6yo5yhrHIa?si=v6m8psTfQMa5Uowcr6mbhA) is my playlist.

If you want to make contact, there are some options:

Well... there aren't so many options, but I'll add more later.
